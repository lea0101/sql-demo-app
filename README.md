Files for my CS 348 Project.

This project uses a MySQL Server hosted in Google Cloud..

To test locally, clone the entire repository. You will need the latest version of node installed.

Then, in the 348-project/ directory, run `npm start`. This will start the frontend of the project.
Open a separate command prompt and go to the express/ directory, then also run `npm start`. This will start the backend server, which will handle all interfacing with the MySQL database.
